## 2024-09-08 - 2hr: Imported assets for simple tile map and made a level
* Item 1 - I searched around itch.io for a while and ended up buying a asset pack that perfectly fits my theme
* Item 2 - Ran into some issue's with player character not proporly moving along the map
* Item 3 - Was able to fix the problem by updating the physics layer to be more flat so the player can traverse normally
